  * OFTC is now featuring full **DNSSEC support**. Both the *oftc.net* and
    *geo.oftc.net* zones are signed and verifiable from the DNS root. Additionally,
    TLSA (aka [DANE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities))
    records allow verification of the individual SSL certificate fingerprints
    of our IRC servers.

    On related news, our old *oftcdns* load-balancing for IRC servers based on
    Python Twisted has been replaced by a
    [newer implemetation based on *bind9*](https://github.com/oftc/oftc-tools/tree/master/infrastructure/geodns)
    and dynamic DNS updates.
