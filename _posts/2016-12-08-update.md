  * OFTC is using [**DroneBL**](https://dronebl.org/) (and EFnet RBL) to
    automatically block incoming IRC connections from hosts known to be
    compromised. Starting last week, DroneBL is now enforced in the firewalls.
    Previously affected connections were rejected on the IRC level with a "This
    host is infected" akill message; these connections will now receive a TCP
    RST.

    If you have trouble connecting, check DroneBL's
    [IP lookup form](https://dronebl.org/lookup).
    Once the DroneBL listing is removed, you should be able to connect again.
    If you keep receiving an akill message, contact
    [support@oftc.net](mailto:support@oftc.net) to get that removed as well.
