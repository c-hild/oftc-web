  * We have completed the move to SSL certificates issued by the
    [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) project. These certificates
    should remove the need for users to manually install any CA certificate
    files. Please drop by on #oftc or mail support@oftc.net if you have any
    troubles with the new certificates.

    OFTC would like to thank
    [Software in the Public Interest](http://spi-inc.org/)
    for providing us with certificate services over the last years, when
    non-commercial SSL certifcates where a scarce resource.
