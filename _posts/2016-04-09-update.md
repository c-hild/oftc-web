  * We have completed the move to SSL certificates issued by the
    [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) project. These certificates
    should remove the need for users to manually install any CA certificate
    files. Please drop by on #oftc or mail support@oftc.net if you have any
    troubles with the new certificates.

    OFTC would like to thank
    [Software in the Public Interest](http://spi-inc.org/)
    for providing us with certificate services over the last years, when
    non-commercial SSL certifcates where a scarce resource.

    *Update 2016-04-19:* Users who have hard-coded paths to CA files in their
    client config will need to update or remove that config. Especially irssi
    users are hit by this problem. Removing ssl_cafile from ~/.irssi/config
    (but leaving ssl_verify in place) should fix it. (Note that /reconnect does
    not use the new config, use /reload /disconnect /connect instead.)
